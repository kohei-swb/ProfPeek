# ProfPeek

ProfPeek is a Chrome extension that helps students make smarter course registration decisions by displaying professor ratings and course GPA data (from external sources) directly within the registration interface (e.g., Workday).

## Status

Work in Progress (WIP)  
Currently supports displaying professor ratings.  
Planned improvements include GPA data integration and a more polished UI.

## Features (MVP)

- Automatically detects professor names once a course section is expanded
- Displays pre-collected professor insights (e.g., overall rating, difficulty, would take again %)
- Planned: GPA statistics integration
- Planned: Clean UI with badges or tooltip-style info cards


## Preview

Coming soon â€“ screenshot or GIF of the extension in action

## Target Audience

- Students using Workday to register for courses
- Anyone who wants professor insights without leaving the registration page

## Tech Stack

- Chrome Extension API
- Static JSON-based professor data (pre-collected from external sources)

## Author

Developed by [Kohei](https://github.com/kohei-swb)  
I was frustrated by the time-consuming process of switching tabs just to check professor reviews during course registration.  
This extension solves that problem by integrating key information directly into the registration interface.
