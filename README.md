# UBCProfPeek

UBCProfPeek is a Chrome extension that helps UBC students make smarter course registration decisions by displaying professor ratings (from RateMyProfessors) and course GPA data (from UBCGrades) directly within the Workday registration interface.

## Status

Work in Progress (WIP)  
This project is still under development. Currently supports professor rating display after expanding a course section in Workday.  
UBCGrades integration and improved UI are planned.

## Features (MVP)

- Automatically detects professor names once a course section is expanded
- Fetches RateMyProfessors data (Overall rating, Difficulty, Would Take Again %)
- Planned: GPA statistics from UBCGrades
- Planned: Clean UI with badges or tooltip-style info cards

## Preview

Coming soon â€“ screenshot or GIF of the extension in action

## Target Audience

- UBC students using Workday to register for courses
- Anyone who wants professor insights without leaving the registration page

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript / Chrome Extension API
- DOM mutation observer to detect expanded sections
- Unofficial RateMyProfessors API (or scraping fallback)
- UBCGrades data integration (planned)
